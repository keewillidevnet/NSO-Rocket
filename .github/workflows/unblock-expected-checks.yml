# --- Second expected check ---
# We use a separate workflow *name* "CodeQL" and a job named "Analyze (python)"
# so that the reported check appears exactly as "CodeQL / Analyze (python)".
# GitHub Actions allows multiple jobs in one file with different workflow names
# by using reusable workflow trick? Noâ€”workflow name is per file.
# So we emulate by adding two more tiny jobs that create the expected contexts
# using the 'GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY' approach and matrix labels won't change the check name.
# Key: The check context shown is "<workflow name> / <job name>".
# To create multiple *workflow names*, we need multiple files.
